<body><h1>Pablo Neruda</h1>
    <p>I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,   
        I love you directly without problems or pride:
        I love you like this because I don’t know any other way to love,
        except in this form in which I am not nor are you,   
        so close that your hand upon my chest is mine,   
        so close that your eyes close with my dreams.</p>
